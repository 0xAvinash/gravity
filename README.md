# ![Gravity logo](https://github.com/marcobambini/gravity/blob/master/logo.svg) Gravity Programming Language

Gravity is a powerful, open-source, dynamically typed, lightweight, embeddable programming language written in C (C99) without any external dependency (except stdlib). It is a class based concurrent scripting language with a modern Swift like syntax. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming and data-driven programming.

By design it has a clear distinction between the compiler itself (frontend and backend) and the runtime and the executable format is an highly portale JSON file (future version could include a binary representation).
